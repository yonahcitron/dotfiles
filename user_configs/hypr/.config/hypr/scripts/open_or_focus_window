# NOTE:
# 1. For context, the hyprland dispatcher has no reliable way of signalling whether a window has been successfully loaded.
# Ideally, we'd be able to execute command on a window in a blocking way to ensure it's fully loaded. However, due to the architecture of hyprland, this isn't possible. Nor is it possible to get the window's pid from the dispatch command and poll for it to be the loaded.
#  However, there does exist a list of created windows (chronologically) which can be used to work out which was created most recently, as seen in the below logic.
# 2. Workspace rules to 'snap' windows to a workspace cannot be used here, as they only apply at creation if the tags are already present. In this case, we add the tags *after* the window has been created (there's no other easy way to do this), so we must also apply the window rules in this script rather that as hyprland windowrulev2's.
