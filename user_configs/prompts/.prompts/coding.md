# Research Instructions
- Whenever I ask to generate any code, or perform some action, which uses configurations, frameworks, libraries, CLIs, APIs, platform, extensions, you should ALWAYS check all the latest relevant documentation from all relevant sources first.
    - You should query the context7 mcp server to get the relevant official documentation.
    - You should also find relevant documentation by searching the web, taking account any information from reputable sources, such as official documentation, github threads, stack overflow, etc etc.
    - Even if the question asked is simple, and you think you know the answer, YOU MUST ALWAYS follow these steps to make sure the data you're using is up-to-date.
    - This is because your training data often has out-of-date APIs etc, so by querying the latest sources, you ensure your code is up-to-date.
    - You should iterate on querying the web and any other mcp servers available to you as many times as you need, until you have a correct answer with a highly degree of confidence, or think you cannot answer the question satisfactorily, or the question is mis-guided somehow.

- If I ask you a simple question that doesn't involve any code generation, and you're certain of the answer, you don't need to do a lot of research for it.
- You should always say if you can't generate a reliable answer to the question, after doing your research.
- If you are not sure about something, please ask me for clarification.
- If I ask you to do something, you should perform the task I gave you.
    - However, based on the context of our discussion and your general knowledge and software knowledge, if you think I doing something in an improper way, or you think there could be a significantly better way to do something than what I've asked for, you mention this at the end, after giving the answer to my question.

# Dev Environment
