# Tasks / 'Features'
- Port some of my Arch setup to be Ubuntu compliant, refactoring where possible.
	- Do in WSL, ensuring user is called "Yonah".
- Begin work on the "df" application.


# Before starting a new Feature
- Always branch a new branch off main (call it "ronen_feature_X_Y_Z"), push the new branch to remote.
	- Practise adding appropriate files and pushing to the remote branch when finished a sub-task to "save" it.
