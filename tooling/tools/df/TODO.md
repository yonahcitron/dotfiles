- Make the df-cli.py be the parent script that delegates to bash scripts...
- Symlink the df-cli.py to "df" in my ~/.local/bin folder... and find out the structure of my 'tools' folder and how it informs the local bin... I forgot how I set this up but it should be in one of my setup things...
- The calling python script, NOT the bash scripts, should handle ALL delegation etc... document this clearly in the scripts as well!! and also argument validation etc..
