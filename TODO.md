ToDo today:
- Use tmux-continuum to save environment variables in tmux resurrect sessions?
- Maybe use vim -obsession to get back vim state? And also maybe save any buffers or whatever automatically? all of this seems like useful stuff in general to be honest...
- Add wifi to the status bar in tmux...
- Make yanking in zsh also copy it to the clipboard... this is super useful actually so I should implement with a relatively high priority...
- Remember to add single-line hyprland shortcuts to individual tmux windows within particular sessions...
- Install and get working the tmux vim integrator thing...

- soooon actually setup copilot properly with the new work subscription.. use it properly, set up good shortcut, etc etc... spend some real time on itttt to make it really goooood...


- resurrect is great, but I want to have a default setup for my "central-command" tmux session that I save, from tmux resurrect... make a default layout that is stored in my dotfiles and applied if there is nothing already in that file... at first install basically.. means I don't need to set it all up every time!! Get my central-command session to the kinda layout I'd want as a default, get the config in the file path, and basically copy it to the default target of tmux resurrect if it's not already there (in .local/share)


- TODO ON FLIGHT:
  - save all the windows as a permanent tmux resurrect to this specific session...
  - rather than having mainmod + number default to switching between hyprland workspaces, have the number correspond to opening specific windows on tmux, resurrecting them to their defaults... keep mainmod + space for the main 0 "home" window
  - fix the cpu and battery indicator issues... get a wifi indicator on my tmux setup...
  - when I open kitty for some reason an error thing comes up in a separate window... fix that
  - install vim tmux integrations so that I can switch between windows within vim (whilst in tmux itself)...
  - validate whether the device and os-specific zshrc stuff is working correctly?
  - Have window *4* on my default tmux session be "obsidian" or something... maybe also have the obsidian app itself, and then try out both for a while and see which one I prefer?... maybe just call the whole session "me" or "me-pad" or something like that ??
  - I think maybe make the caps lock be control, and swap the control and super keys at the bottom... think about whether it's more ergonomic??
    - I think this makes more sense as the control key will be universally useful across different OS's for my muscle memory... whilst the super key is less so... also, I think I use the super key more, and using my thumb rather than my pinky is more ergonomic and will hurt my pinky less!
    - Rather than making a 'df todo' command or something, just keep the 'todo' in the current session on window three (with a shortcut to it ofc)... and then work out the nvim git commands... and make a shortcut specifically for the todo file to add, give an auto commit with the message, and then push (and pull first just that file to validate...)
    - make the shortcuts for the tmux windows be ... 'restore XXX session' (with a name)... and only do that conditionally if not already loaded... and then load window XX...
 
- Make part of the initial startup script(s) that it installed onedrive and github, checks whether each of them are logged in, and, if they're not, prompts you to log in from the terminal (e.g. `gh auth login` and the equivalent for onedrive)..
- practise quickly moving quickly between open buffers in vim... if there are none I think map to shift + hjkl
- SORT OUT THE .TMUX.CONF ... IN THE STATUS BAR AT THE TOP... MAYBE JUST DOWNLOAD EVERYTHING THROUGH TPM AND SEE IF IT WORKS?? OTHERWISE TRY THE MANUAL DOWNLOAD ROUTE... MAKE THE CPU FUNCTIONALITY AND ALSO THE BATTERY FUNCTIONALITY WORK COZ IT WILL LOOK NICER
- Make a separate hyprland space (mainmod + T) which just opens a kitty terminal workspace... can use this for general system / ad hoc commands, and if I want a terminal outside of tmux..
- Remap the fn + sleep button to hibernate, and confirm that pressing the power button translates into a safe power off... check this in the system settings and stuff and then use that for power off...
- Make it that when I go onto each of the tmux sessions.. it opens all my usual windows with resurrect or something.. look into how resurrect works underlyingly and what things it actually restarts / what it preserves etc...
- Think about maybe NOT needing vim-tmux integration... because I actually DON'T necessarily want to be switching manually between the two... want to maybe just have my own custom keybindings to take me to those places, perhaps in another window, perhaps in the same... either way, have a think about it... but work it out incrementally...
- FIND A WAY TO MAKE HYPRLAND ONLY PUT A BORDER ON WINDOW WHEN THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WINDOW IN THE WORKSPACE... OTHERWISE IT LOOKS BETTER TO HAVE NO BORDER... E.G. TMUX PANES AND STUFF ARE CLEARER.... do this soon as it should be preettyyyy easy and will make a good difference to the feel!!!!!!!!!!
- Get a better hyprpaper background?
- When I get home, set up ssh on my mac and then make a tmux SESSION that will contain that connection and everything contained within it...
- Remember, on my main computer desktop with the screens (only active when it detect the correct hostname), make the logic: mainmod + shift opens or moves a window to the centre screen... any window already in the centre screen gets moved to its default non-centre location.... opening an app with just the mainmod key checks first whether there's anything in the centre screen... if not, it opens it there (maybe make this a function)... if there is something already there, it opens it in its usual location... if two apps are in the same position in the non-centre screen, one simply covers the other... you can show the one which is hidden by simply clicking its shortcut again.. this is because I want every app to have a defined place that it rests in the two side-screens..
- In chrome, practise using control + number to select tabs, rather than clicking on them or using control + tab... simpler, quicker, and more ergonomic...
- Simplify some of my setup to be cross platform... like some of the plugins in my .bashrc or whatever that are done differently between arch and ubuntu... do them both the manual way, downloading using the direct github clone and setup, rather than by the individual package managers, to simplify cross-platform installation...
- Practise not using the touchpad... use only the trackpoint + trackpoint button NOW THAT IT CAN CLICK NORMALLY WOOOOOO

- Consider making a hyprland shortcut that will actually change the active SESSION in a single hyprland workspace to a different window containing my terminal commands.. this way, I can have a single 'session' containing all my related code things.. like any relevant nvim repos, my terminals for a given task, etc etc... reopen them every time with the tmux respawn thing, but still navigate between them with simple hyprland chords rather than having to do that manually through tmux every time... although when working on non-native setups, like wsl on ubuntu etc, the structure is still there, and I can simply do the slightly more verbose tmux chords but will have the same fundamental layout etc which is good
- Get remapping my keys ... get all the volume keys working, make the 'delete' be cut in wayland, and the insert be paste?
    - Make screenshot button at some point maybe? the f7 key potentially...
    - make the todo add command for df because actually I use this all the time and it's super useful... make it do a git pull of just the todo file, then append the line, then add just that, then send an automated commit of it.. then put... like "Added to TODO.md: "
    - Change remappings to make meta + hjkl move between workspaces, and meta + shift + hjkl move between windows... because nowadays I'm using workspace -related functionality much more than window-related...
    - Check if volume keys are already working? Make them work if not. Then, for brightness keys and volume keys, make little notifications windows pop up to signify the changes in volume / brightness...
- At some point really soon try do some remapping for keyd instaed of interception-tools so I can do oneshot functionality to make my life easier... or even see if this is something that interception tools can do natively itself?? 
    - Look into oneshot functionality in general, across the internet and for ergonomics, and whether it's better, whether people prefer it, whether there are any downsides, etc ... and then optimize for it...
- Make todoist non blurry! find out how asap...
- TOMORROW: read the chatgpt answer (research mode) for remapping caps lock etc... and implement!!!
- Practise not really using the vim terminal.. I should use the same terminal(s) for all my apps with the same keybinding to access (mainmod + enter)... rather than having a separate one for vim... also find a WAY ASAP to make it so that I can navigate the output of a terminal session, in my zsh etc, without having to click and select stuff myself which is rather annoying...
- Make in my hyprland.conf and bash and things like this in general suggestions for variables come up automatically.. currently variable suggestions aren't coming up!!! but in order to do this I need to sort out my copilot remapping which it would interfere with.. I've detailed it elsewhere but basically I want to be able to with good keybinding go through suggestions WHEN I WANT... so that they don't pop up automatically coz that's annoying..
- Find a good dictation - to -typing software for arch (my setup), and make a keybinding to one of the f-keys to be able to quickly enable typing from voice... and toggle to disable again ofc..
- Make a functionality that auto logs into yonah and just prompts for my password / my finger being scanned automatically... and gives you the option to not do a graphical boot..
- Make a 'df vi' command...
- Maybe at some point make meta + a number map to an automatic script or something... because I don't need the functionality to go to a specific workspace functionality anymore really...
- FIRST THING THAT I SHOULD DO:: Make it so that when I hold down the caps key it functions as the super key! tap once for esc, tap twice (or shift + caps... work out which one is better) for caps lock...
- WORK OUT WHY SOME WORKSPACES AREN'T WORKING PROPERLY IN HYPRLAND... LIKE THEY'RE NOT OPENING IN THEIR OWN DEDICATED WORKSPACE FOR SOME REASON...
- Find out WHY when I press the esc key, in the terminal, it takes a little while for the cursor to go back to being square rather than a thin line, even though the esc itself happens very quickly?
- See if I can add SHIFT + caps or double tap of caps to enable caps lock, using my current interception-tools setup?
- HYPRLAND DOES *NOT* GO BACK TO PREVIOUS WORKSPACE WHEN YOU CLOSE A WORKSPACE WITH SUPER q... IT GOES TO THE HIGHEST NUMERICALLY... MAYBE KEEP A CACHE OF ORDERED WORKSPACE CHANGES OR SOMETHING FOR CONVENINCE... OR SEE IF THERE'S A BUILT-IN FUNCTIONALITY FOR THIS...
- Set up gmail on aerc on my laptop...
- Find out how to use the same fuzzy finder search that I do in vim, in the command line... set a single key function shortcut for it, and then find a way to map this to a control + some_key keybinding... do this for yazi as well...
- At some point try migrating properly to "keyd" so that I can get the caps lock functionality that I tried to get the other day...
- Make it so that when I want to edit any particular dotfiles thing, I just do df vi and this will open nvim in the dotfiles repo... I can then do leader leader to search for the particular file that I want.... way easier than having to traverse the cli every time... in general, practise using INTERNAL VIM commands to search the computer for quick access to files...
- Practise defining quick shortcuts for access to particular files etc in nvim... the quickest and best way to do it I think
- Add the different commands in yazi (based on chatgpt reccs) to be able to use it to navigate to a folder, and then when I exit yazi I stay in the folder... also add a shortcut so that 'y' opens yazi...
- CONSIDER switching the SUPER and CONTROL keys... it might actually end up being more ergnomic that way, but have a think and maybe try it out some time in the future...
- Could make something like an 'admin view' for my laptop / desktop respectively... where it takes emails, todoist, and anything else adminey for me to quickly look over, and puts it in one place? may be a bit unnecessary tho
- For now just practise having one tmux workspace and move between my sessions manually to get a feel for how tmux works.. in future I could have different sessions in different workspaces , each with different things that I can resurrect using the tmux resurrection tool (find out in detail how this works ofc..)
- OK basically the setup I should start working on for my home monitors... use the super keys to open windows to their (side) locations... (except maybe nvim which can open to the centre by deafult)... and use shift + super and the key to bring any of them into the fore... when one isn't in the centre, it should move to its side location (overlaying any that might be there already - each should have a fixed location that it goes to always...)
	- In future I can always devise shortcuts to put two apps in the centre screen if I want
	- Also make a shortcut (maybe super + space) to bring focus back to the centre screen... and maybe make it that if I do a double normal key (e.g. super + T + T again)... it will bring it to the centre... so basically if something's already selected and you press it again, it brings it to the centre screens...
- In nvim, I can navigate terminal output with vim commands... find out the shortcut to do that without having to click off the cli input first..
- Remove vim-hypr-nav from everywhere it's been installed - vim and nvim, and change back to the default hyprland bindings I had before.
	- I shouldn't actually HAVE to do any moving between vim and hyprland as with each I should stay within the terminal, and can move between tmux and nvim with the bindings for that I'll install (install it for arch and ubuntu, and test on ubuntu on my work wsl machine). Any external apps I wanna move to I can use with the hyprland custom bindings I've made to immediately switch to that window... should have one instance of each app running at any time (except maybe chatgpt which has its own command), in a specific location of the screen on a specific workspace... so apps should immediately pop up and down when I want.
	- In future, for multi-monitor setups, so that I don't need to switch to a whole new workspace if I wanna superimpose a different app onto a part of the screen but keep the existing apps on that screen / workspace there, work out / write a script to 'minimize' and replace apps in a given location. The idea is I should be able to quickly switch out apps. I will need to make some custom logic for when I want to be able to send e.g. a chrome window on the main screen to a side position and back... by default, the app should open on the main screen, checking for the existence of it in side locations, ...
- Can also practise setting up just script that run from keybindings in hyprland... there doesn't always have to be a gui app that shows up ! or for something like a background update, could press a keybinding, and then it could open up silently on another window... basically can update my workflow as I go to make it easier for myself...
	- *or acts better idea thn this* ... make the default workspaces with default apps , and make keybindings to move them to specific areas of the screen... specific keybindings should be able to open either speciif capps whether or not they're opened 
- Find out how to make control + f in the terminal map to opening yazi?
- MAKE HYPRLAND SCRIPT THAT TOGGLES BETWEEN THE TERMINAL WORKSPACE AND THE ONE THAT I WAS USING JUST BEFORE IT... (PREVIOUS WORKSPACE... MIGHT BE A SHORTCUT FOR IT!!!!!).... AND MAKE ME BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT (THE TERMINAL WORKSPACE... OPENING A KITTY WINDOW (OR WHATEVER CONSOLE I'M USING) IN WORKSPACE 1 IF IT'S NOT ALREADY OPEN!!!!!!
	- Make all the shortcuts to open programs on my computer within easy reach of both fingers.. maybe just use the fingers on my left hand?? might actually make it ergonomic and nicer....
	- Maybe make a script to hide and show a chatgpt instance on the given workspace that I'm on (open it if it's not already, just minimise it if it is)... make it tiling to begin with and change this if I want... I may want to change the setup of how I use this but even if and when I do, say I start using chat in a different window, KEEP the script for future reference because chances are I'll wanna implement a similar thing at some point anyways..


- Make a little function for the brightness / connect the function buttons to brightness....
- PRACTISE: Using the 'lg' alias instead of lazygit every time!!!! also make a single command to do lazygit for dotfiles...
- I THINK ADAPT MY CURRENT SYSTEM... rather than switching with super + shift + numbers to different workspaces, have LETTERS that will always take me to a new workspace and open the app if it's not open... so for example, super + W will always take me to a desktop with whatsapp on it (called whatsapp or whatever)... some apps can share desktops, like email and whatsapp (?? maybe, or maybe just use the terminal)...
- !!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!! MAKE SEPARATE .BASHRC'S and probably .zshrc's for platform specific things which will go into the platform-specific dotfiles folders that I already have and source wherever there are relevant bashrc's etc for that platform... move some of the stuff out of my general bashrc to the platform specific ones... e.g. the 'upower' error that I'm getting for non-arch distros!!!
- AS A PRIORITY GET TO GRIPS WITH THE API OF USING THE NVIM COPILOT CHAT WITH THE SHORTCUTS
- Practise noticing that in zsh GREEN files have their executable flag set... whereas white ones don't!!! very useful for debugging!!!
- In my documentation of the 'setup', be more explicit about what I'm actually DOING with the 'stow' command for the cmdlet folder... I'm basically INSTALLING everything so that it's executable onto my system... just reference this...
- PRACTISE THAT in my terminal in nvim, I can use vim command to navigate around the terminal window output, copying things from there etc!! super cool...
	- Also find a way to do this in normal tmux windows... so that I can navigate around the output as well as the input... and how to navigate out without clicking...
- Basically shouldn't have to think about desktop management myself is the idea... so basically all apps will open in the specific places I always want them on the right desktop... but I should vary this according to each device and the number of screens... DECIDE whether this should be handle at the dotfiles level, by giving separate devices a separate hyprland config, or MORE LIKELY, in the hyprland config file itself as a single monolith file... 
- Practise just using my 'vi' alias instead of typing nvim every time..
- Make a dotfiles 'todo' command / script, and find a way to make the wifi logo appear on the status bar in my terminal...
- And then also practise using the df todo command to add todos on the fly.... it should first do a git pull specifcially on the todo file, and then attmept to modify it, and then push it... actually just 
- Change all instances of $dotfiles to $DOTFILES as it's a global variable, in my bash scripts...
	- The only app that maybeee needs to spawn multiple windows in any desktop is chatgpt... but even then, I plan to streamline it all into my terminal... I should then control ALL multiple windows of an app within the app itself for simplicity... so use tmux to manage different terminal applications... and can have different sessions for email browsing, and other functions etc...
- This being the case, I should definitely use the control key with tmux and nvim as my primary means of navigations... furthermore, I shouldn't switch between windows on the same desktop as often, so maybe switch between them with shift + super, and just have plain SUPER + hjkl allow me to swtich between actual workplaces, which I will then be doing more frequently... in this way, the workspace will become the primary means of multitasking, and generally speaking every high-level GUI app should have its own workspace... the terminal should control most sub-apps with tmux...
  - Really spend time learning all of the tmux shortcuts.... some would be really useful, and it's an entirely cross-platform app that's like a little operating system... really cool stuff!!
	- Also it actually seems unnecessary to have gmail and whatsapp share a workspace... have them have a separate one indeed...!!!
	- In terms of my desktop setup and using multiple monitors, where perhaps I may want to split the screen into two (I think more than this is unncessary tbh), I should figure that out on the go...
	- But at the high level when I open an app with super + w for example for whatsapp, it should open it at a DEFAULT location on my screens... i.e. a given app ALWAYS opens at the same place in the screens (opening if it's not opening, and COVERING another app that's already in that location if there's one there)... this way, I will get used to ALWAYS have the same apps in the same places, which I can navigate to with just a keyboard press, without having to be confused about where thigns over... I can optimise which things can be where etc over time... 
# TODO: Change the e.g. "setup" command, and similar, to be part of the 'df' application. For quick one-word commands like this, I can just set aliases from that.
- This is how I should do updates...
	- In the .zprofile, or whatever runs at first login, I should do a git status check for the dotfiles repo.. if there's an update, it should prompt to press enter to pull updates and apply changes..
- Make hyprland dispatch scripts for opening all the different apps as I described them above... I can make scripts for them...
- There are issues with the .zprofile... fix them! (only do the check if there's internet, first check this...do a git pull, make sure that it check the timestamp and only prompts to sync if the latest commit on the remote is MORE RECENT than the local... if the local is MORE RECENT than the remote, prompt to do a push...
- In terms of how platform specific stuff should work... in each platform specific script, i.e. the install 'setup' script (make across all platforms) and the .zshrc etc scripts, I shold check for the folder of my dotfiles location with the $DISTRO path for what I'm using... if it's not present it should raise an error... it should do the same for device specific config (by checking the hostname), except not raise an error if these aren't found, just don't apply any device-specific stuff.. 
- Refactor all of the setup scripts such that they share global variables and these are passed to them... rather than having to define the common scripts in every called file etc... this is a better way of doing it...
- Think about the pros and cons of using just the tty's when I don't want to load the whole hyprland shtick... find the keybaord shortcuts with my current setup to swtich between them...
- sort out my font situation with the correct nerdfonts etc set up correctly..
- Make a switch when I'm starting hyprland from the cli to start it in complete dark mode, with a black background or something any any other settings, for when I want this..
- stop my fuzzy file search indexing all files including binaries etc as wayyy too slow..
- In my terminal oh-my-zsh setup, if it detects that the running console is a tty with limited glyph support, it should remove the glyphs from the bar rather than fail to render them...
- Add all the tmux setup stuff that was listed in the video I watched... with the nice bar and stuff, and the extensions, which the guy with the mousetache listed... also practise using some good shortcuts for github copilot integrated into nvim... 
- make separate executable flags for the df commands... so make it for example that I can run the 'setup' command without doing a full database refresh to save time, or just do the installs, or something like that..
- In the initial logic of the 'df' app, make a section that checks the os version / release, and then sets up everything based on that... assumes am running a posix compliant os of course for simplicity... or could have python handle the logic that hands off the scripts, running the bash scripts ... in things like the .zshrc, when I want OS-specific logic, I should handle that by having a mapping that tells where to look up specific setup files (using a variable for the path to the right folder) for a specific os... if a particular os's env var isn't found in the setup, or if that particular file isn't found, it should raise a warning..
- NEXT THING RUN 'SETUP' AND CHECK THE FONT SITUATION IS BEING UPDATED CORRECTLY AND THAT i'M USING JETBRAINS MONO IN KITTY (SET IT IN MY CONFIG) ... AND IN THE ZSH OF MY TTY (SEE IF THIS IS WORKING)... AND MAKE SURE IT'S GLOBALLY APPLIED BASICALLY ...
- At some point soon cancel my chatgpt subscription, and use maybe the api instead with some cli app for simplicity... (then can replace super + enter for opening a new terminal...) and use the best integration for chatting in the terminal as well ... this will be a lot easier and more user-friendly, and also save me money.... see if there are free API versions of more powerful apps like deepseek, including search etc...
- Make tmux start with zsh not with bash... also for now to simplify I think get rid of the vim-hyprland bindings... and instead just for vim and tmux using control, and keep the super key for window-manager level things... this is probably better for now...
	- In future, to keep things good, I can try integrate everything with vim-tmux navigator as well as with vim, might need to write my own stuff... but for now, I'll mainly have a window for all my stuff when I'm using vim and tmux, so just keep control for that... separate out of the hyprland global stuff...
- Make an automated part of .zshrc to download powerlevel10k if it doesn't already exist??
     - Go to the repo for powerlevel10k and make sure that I'm globally installing the recommended font for it... in general, have a think about what font(s) I want for my system and make sure to use them..
- Fix startup issues where text is being printed when I start zsh ...
- Make flag to skip updating packages (but install any new ones) in the df setup or whatever command... e.g. df setup --no-update ... this is for when I don't want updates but I do want new installs... can also make a --no-install flag for when I don't want to update OR install packages...
- Add a section near the end of the .bashrc which sources a "target_specific_configs" script... this should be kept in the 'common' or 'shared' section of 'setup'... also under 'setup' should be a file (ask chatgpt for the best type - maybe a local_config.conf or something... ask chat to come up with a better name than that..) that has details of what platform I'm running, what device (if any, have a default value if none)... this is then used to go to the "mappings.conf" or smt (also in the root), which resolves all the platform / device-specific configurations that I might want...
    - even within arch, I might have different devices with different settings etc that I want to configure... these should be configued by, within a platform folder like 'arch', having another folder 'devices' which contain subconfigurations... the target_specific_configs script or whatever I wanna call it should look up the local_config (and populate it if not already done), then it should get the relevant paths from the mappings.conf, and then apply and source them etc...
    - Make the upower command and related in the platform-specific configurations so I don't get the errors I'm currently getting... also add the fonts... also add the ubuntu configurations, and test on the ubuntu platform!!
- Also refactor the .bashrc and .zshrc so that it's modular... it should call a few high-level functions like "get_global_configs", "get_platform_configs", "get_device_configs" which are called in that order... each of the level can override general variables like dotfiles that might have their default defined in the global configs... but these are overridden only if any platforms / devices are found... so all the code should be called, but resolved in order of specificity... this should neaten the .bashrc and .zshrc quite a lot... do the same with both maybe...
# Get harpoon on nvim and practising getting them... 
# TODO: Make a little dotfiles cmdlet so I don't need to always be in the in the dotfiles folder to do things... with commands like dotfiles update (which does add, prints changes, commits, and pushes), dotfiles apply, dotfiles status, dotfiles unapply (or find a better word from chatgpt), dotfiles install (which does an update of AUR / pacman, downloads the package locally, and then appends it to the packages file so that it will be downloaded to all machines.) Also maybe add a command like 'dotfiles todo add -m "Some thing that I want to do"'... and that command simply appends (>>) the message onto the end of the TODO.md there...  Currently most of the todos are in the readme, and in various other files (grep all the files to find where they all are)... but consolidate them eventually into the TODO.md which stores all this stuff..
# TODO: Also remember to implement the startup logic on my machine (I've specified it I think in tododist or maybe one of my readmes) that checks for dotfiles updates etc in github and syncs between them. Read the docs I wrote there for details
#     Whenever I do updates to configs, download new files

# TODO: Set up good system font etc. Currently I am downlaoding one from yay.
#       Set up jetbrains mono for the terminal etc, and maybe something different for chrome?
#       Although anyways I think it by default has a different font, double-check on this though.
# TODO: Maybe implement some keybinding (also maybe in hyprland.conf) to open a quick central command popup window to run single short quick commandd, rather than having to go to a whole terminal... e.g. 'power' just to see quick status of battery etc..
# TODO: In general, in nvim, find a good way to make 'section headers' (maybe using some sort of autosyntax, to generate the above style uusing ### (the same as in hypr.conf)... and then find a good way to list them and navigate to them quickly in nvim...
      - So basically make a function in nvim like :Header "name of header" that will automatically create the headers..
#- Also make a way to do search using / in an case-insensitive way (although not by default... also make a way to do a add-commit-push git workflow with some automated message... for now could jsut be 'trivial change'... but in the future could use chatgpt for this or something... or copilot.. ?? look around what exists online

# also set up git email and username so I don't have to configure it first time... for privacy, like the guy online said... don't actually give my REAL email, find the github anonymous email or whatever it's called... (look this up online!)
#	- Also potentially start giving workspace numbers fixed names... like "1: Chrome", "2: Tmux", "5: Whatsapp", etc etc... make them also print on the top right as well as the number!! so that I get a sense of WHERE I am in the workspace manager and what each workspace should be used for...
#		This will also help teach me that if I'm opening too many tabs in a workspace not designed for that, I should create an ADDITIONAL workspace rather than trying to crowd one workspace with just that!!!!
#

#- Also make a thing that WHENEVER the super key in hyprland is held down, it automatically shows (in the top right) the workspace number! this would be very convenient..
- Also make configuring the default fonts for system, for hyprland, etc , part of the setup
- why is tmux so useful??
	- Bc it allows you to have a cross-platform operating environment whatever OS I'm on... so if I'm using tmux on wsl, arch, or macos, I can integrate the same commands for most of my workflow, and going forwards it shouldn't matter what platform I'm working on, I should be able to keep a very similar environment across all OS's, which is great!
	- WATCH  bunch of of vids asap on all the tmux functionalities, and how to use them well...
- In myzsh somewhere, print the os that I'm using - for now: arch OR macOS or ubuntu
- Install ghcs into my setup so that I can easily get commands from the cli...
- In order to be able to do anything on my windows machine (wsl), I need to change my username from yonah_wsl to just yonah to be consistent... tbh, probably easiest just to uninstall and reinstall wsl to keep things simple... 
- Remove the relative line-numbers from vim! I don't actually use them that much, and if I want to do relative jumps I can just eyeball it. Absolute numbers are more useful! Change my settings.
- Add all the tmux things from typecraft's 3 videos... tell Ronen?? I have reminders in todoist as well?...
- At some point consider:: using (some) of the function buttons on my arch desktop to open apps in certain windows... 
- In the initial install script:  also set up git email and username so I don't have to configure it first time... for privacy, like the guy online said... don't actually give my REAL email, find the github anonymous email or whatever it's called... (look this up online!)
#
- Remap the function key on my laptop to open an emoji selector... or another key.. or make some shortcuts maybe?? or I can select the emoji I want with vim keybindings when I open it...
- Start using '+' bullet points for sub-bullets... and maybe * for prominent bullets in md??..
- Think the best way to use copilot whilst coding is to NOT have the 'grey' recommendations, and then tab to continue, but rather to find a way in nvim to generate a suggestion when I want... I know when I want copilot to continue inline, so I should just be able to press a button to see suggestions when I want it... it should not 'pre-prompt' it before I want it, as I KNOW when I want it and can use my discretion for this...
- depending on what's ergonomic, maybe actually swap BOTH slashes with the shift keys... they're smaller, but they're more ergonomic to reach... consider this!!! obvs do the caps-lock remapping when I have time!!
- IMPLEMENT 'account switcher' on my mac as well (and myabe also on my personal machine) so I can easily switch between two different account on different machines..
	- REALLY MAKE THE COMMANDS GOOD FOR WSL, and make zsh look pretty / the same as it does on my other machines... also make shortcuts etc to useful places... for now just put these in the .bashrc, but soon soon do it properly...
	- Also set up the windows laptop well, to use wsl as the default shell, do any remaps, etc etc...
        - Set distro specific paths as well, based on setup, in my basrc and stuff... think about how best to do this, but make it highly configurable... that would be super useful indeed!
        -  Make shortcuts in windows to move between open windows... see if there's a good extension for this ...
        - Especially add zsh, and all my configs to my wsl machine that I install on my windows laptop ... for now just use ubuntu at work... this will be good, just add a ubuntu extra distro to my df with all my setups for wsl... could even call it ubunut_wsl??
- In general, when I wanna use copilot on a personal project via my shell subscription, I can add my shell github account as a contributor, log in using that, and then just continue contributing using that account.. e.g. what I'm doing at the moment to update these dotfiles using my shell account!!!
- GET MY MAC RE-IMAGED AT WORK!!! need to do this quickly so I can use it again...
      - Double check on the way to the office tomorrow that there's not anything on there I don't want deleted.. otherwise just get it re-imaged and set a reminder to get it working again!!!
- First thing tomorrow make a quick script to put the iso file onto the usb (partitioning the usb if not already - make it optional) and if creating a new partition only taking up as much space as is needed by the iso image... work it out dynamically in the script...
-
- FIND OUT why in the emulated version when I run arch-setup.sh (don't need to reinstall the whole thing at all, just need to run the script...) I still get errors!! work out what they are (wihtout reinstalling the iso etc..) and fix them!!!
- set up new keyboard on desktop asap..
- On the install arch script, instead of prompting the user to enter the formatted partition names again, work them out automatically based on the mountpoint names that are printed with lsblk etc.. will save time..
- Find out how to have MULTIPLE GITHUB ACCOUNTS on the same computer so when pushing ,pulling, doing different stuff for personal and work etc etc, I can easily switch between the two...
- Set up my keymaps for my mac at work, and for my windows at work, and set up ideally window managers on each of them, so they are super easy to switch between and everything works well...
     - Of course, refactor my dotfiles file etc so that I can sync different settings etc etc between different machines easily... modularise it properly...
- Set up the good shortcuts I found for copilot chat... from the main repo... set them up properly this time...
      - Set up custom things for each operating system... for mac os, do the keymappings and custom commands using karabiner elements to be able to switch between workspaces etc using my own custom commands... this is definitely a good thing to aspire towards!!!
     - Make as many of the commands in 'df' as possible system-agnostic.. so that I can easily switch between my different setups and it should work on all of them!! that would be super useful and cool!!
- Find a way to ignore files in certain folders within telescope so that it doesn't index binaries etc ... especially in my dotfiles repo it gets very slow... set this up!!
- with the `makepkg -si` line... it's causing me to have to confirm atm... see if there's a --noconfirm way to do this??
- download old repos from mac and put on onedrive asap!!!
- Whilst working on work stuff, IN MY HOME OFFICE... ACTUALLY DO THE WORK ON MY ARCH MACHINE!!!! ... all I need to do is setup up a connection to my work mac on ssh, and use nvim + tmux through there... also obvs have my laptop open on teams bc I can't access that through the cli... super cool!!!! DO THIS AS A PRIORITY... SET UP SSH ON MY LOCAL NETWORK TO MY WORK MACHINE... save this work configuration as well to my dotfiles... bc soon I wanna get my mac re-imaged ... (CAN DO THIS DURING THE HOLIDAYS...)
      - within this, so my work laptop doesn't fall asleep, run the script to keep the mouse moving at the same time whilst I have my teams open...
- CONFIGURE HIBERNATION IN MY INSTALL SCRIPT WHILST INSIDE ARCH CHROOT!!!!!!!!!! THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IN ADVANCE OF SETUP...
- So that I can use qutebrowser better, switch to using that password manager I switched to the other day, and get it working on qutebrowser...
    - Also try make qutebrowser have gradual scrolling like in nvim when I do control + d and control + u...
    - Make leader key + j and k to switch tabs in nvim...
    - also try get an add / popup blcoker on qutebrowser... and see if it supports extensions like chrome to e.g. make it dark mode screens... ahh it doesn't have these extensions, but can write your own extensions... see if there's a darkmode extension for it, else make my own for the browser to make it useable...
- Run through everything again... reinstall the iso... get the wifi thing working... and really make sure everything works seamlessly! and then also refactor the code... all the testing I wanna do now, I can now do I on my laptop or my main computer natively, as once I've reached the arch-setup script successfully then we're good to go... 
- Make it also that when I do e.g. df global install XXX or any dotfiles install it also takes care of the git versioning, like with my todos, and will add that packages file and push it (as well as doing a pull first etc to make sure it's in sync etc etc)... but again the pull should JUST be for the packages to make sure there are no conflicts and any other packages have been pulled if other machines have done updates since etc...
- Download my shell repos to onedrive asap... from my mac....
- Install github copilot suggest....
- Really clean up my files like arch.setup.sh , move where arch-setup goes (move it into an arch-specific folder, not root of dotfiles)... check everything runs properly, and make sure in the bootloader scripts 'yonah' has root privileges without needing to isntall password
- Clean up the final part of the arch setup script to do nothing when running in chroot... see the error when I run in on the live usb for more details.
- Make a script `make-usb-iso.sh` which check if iso file and then asks if want to create one if not exists
- Make new shortcuts for going back between tabs like in the browser .... like capital J and capital K.... also maybe remap qutebrowser commands itself to be a bit more similar to those that I have in my normal vim.... also get on the remapping of the caps lock to the things that I want it to be...
      - YEAH REALLY MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO REMAP SOME OF THE BASIC VIM THINGS IN QUTEBROWSER... LIKE HAVING JK BEING THE WAY TO GET TO NORMAL MODE ETC...
- Make functionality such that any wifi that was connected to within the iso session is automatically saved within the actual installed iso at startup?? and then starts up automatically..
- In nvim practise relative pasting text with the same indentation using `[p` ... really cool trick!!
- Install one of my spare laptops as an arch server ... make a whole bunch of different variations for different use-cases... make me be able to connect and wake up the server hopefully from it being asleep...?? 
     - Could just get a smart device button-pressing thing for when I wanna turn it on... and then as part of any ssh script into it, have a flag to do this or somethign (can check whether it's awake first)... this might be easier actually and cheaper...
     - Could make a few different boot options for whether I wanna wake it with a screen or not... or perhaps even easier just remove the screen altogether so it takes up less space.... if I'm sure I'm not gonna use it as a laptop... and then just keep the screen elsewhere...
     - ALSO I think I can reuse the mac, check if I can install a new operating system on it!!! if so, can install arch and use that... many good options indeed, could use that as a server, etc etc.... find all machines for this!!!!
     - Remember I don't need the cloud since I'll be storing all my files anyways on onedrive on the server machines... the servers themselves don't need to be on the cloud, don't need that level of reliability, just the files etc which should be what I'm doing anyways!!
     - Also look at the best ways to save energy whilst I'm not using it...
     - Potentially at some point as well look into just getting a really low power device that I just leave on the whole time (like a raspberry pi), look into its power usage, etc etc... cool projects to look into at some point...
     - Really make the list of dependencies separate as well (instead of just packages.txt).. have an arch folder with a global packages, and then have sub packages.txt for each separate distro... and then have df commands like df install global package_x and df install [] package y ... come up with a better word that means just for this particular machine and not for all arch versions I'm running.. maybe like df install local or machine or device or something
- in the arch-chroot-install file it still prompts me for yonah's password... run the whole script again and get it so it doesn't prompt for the password...
- In vscode / nvim, see if there's a way to attach folders from an ssh.. so basically you're writing to a read from a file via ssh! that would be pretty kewl if you could do that...
- Make it for each section of the iso install scripts that there's more interactivity as to whether you want to carry on or not... and that you don't have to click enter to make certain choices (like the arch-emulate script which disk formatting options.. you just hit the number and it does it striaght away..)
- Make it so that my nvim settings apply for the root user as well (i.e. when running vim as sudo..)... look into this and apply it!!!
- MY NVIM IS BEING VERYYYY UNRELIABLE AND BUGGY... FIX IT AS A PRIORITY!!!!!!!!!
- Make the better formatting around "Hit enter to begin install .." like add some **** etc to make it more prominent, and a line break!! check it works on my current vm, then get it to work on the physical computer, then tweak the post-install setup... REMEMBER include as LITTLE AS POSSIBLE on the install in the iso... only what I NEED to do there... any isntall which can be done ont he machine itself post-setup I should MOVE THERE.... means it's configurable from everywhere, and no recompilation needed etc etc.. much better idea!!
- Try alibaba's new model as well as google's...
- READ THROUGH *ALL* OF THE COPILOT CHAT readme etc online...
- SET UP AND PRACTISE COPILOT CHAT IN NVIM, USE IT IN MY WORKFLOW...
- find out what all the errors are when I start nvim... sort them out!!
- Make a `df git` command (when with no args) that opens lazygit for the dotfiles repo...
- make an alias "y" in zsh for "yazi"... so I can quickly access it....
- Make it so when I click on a folder in yazi, it just cd's into that folder, it doesn't open it in nvim.. only open files in nvim...
- Buy a mattress topper...
- in the "make-usb-iso.sh" file, if an iso can't be found in the expected place on disk, it should prompt you if yuo want to generate a new one locally. If yes (default option!), go ahead and source iso-gen.sh, then carry on. It should also have a warning before you start that this can take up to 15 minutes to perform...
- Get a symlink extension for neo-tree to show what files are symlinks, and where they're pointing!!!
- Play around with aerc and how to use it properly...
- Set up secure password storage on aerc rather than using the cleartext password as I am currently..
     - Set up 'aerc' as well using OAuth when I have time... https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~fionn/misc/aerc/
- On nvim put the buffer number next to the buffers at the top so they're easy to switch between visually...
- Add a wifi symbol to my prompt line showing how much internet connection I have from the terminal!! sure this exists, it would be super cool....
- In my home directory, make a folder 'cloud' which contains my onedrive.... in time get round to better organizing my onedrive. Download all my repos to ~/repos, all my meaningful documents to ~/cloud, and maybe make a ~/misc folder for random downloady things I don't really care about / want to keep? 
- At some point make an iso that I can carry with me and use as my live computer environment when on the go with different machines, and boot from.... install some useful things and keep my onedrive on there with everything configure to have access to all my files... make a separate space in it for my dotfiles repo to my installer... this is my "out and about" arch image... can try make things as configurable as possible so that I can run arch wherever I go!! super cool....
- Remap 'll' to just do ls -a .... currently it does ls -la which I don't want...
- todoist-appimage is not avialable via aur... need to write a manual script to get it installed...
- Make it so then when you 'cd' in nvim, neo-tree or whatever file manager is installed automatically refreshes...
- Make shortcut to run the current file and open the output in the terminal, in nvim...
    - I think this shortcut is already built in ... try it ... I think it's space, b, 0
- PRACTISE using control + h for backspace!!!
- Find some app for me that auto-writes git commits... will be super useful...
- Find a feature, either directly in git or lazygit or both, that will detect when a file greater than a certain size has been newly added (say bigger than 20mb) and raise a warning if you try add it!!!
- Get some program (with a keyboard shortcut) that automatically does all indentations for me... so that I don't need to manually re-indent everything myself every time I paste something with the wrong indentation...
- Make a keyboard shortcut in nvim to toggle copilot autosuggestions on / off in the session...
- In nvim, remap control + / to be super + / for consistency....
- Very soon do the thing where I print which workspace I'm in and its name in the top right corner when I move between them.. set that up soon...
- I wanna make it so that control + hjkl moves between tabs in nvim, and super + those keys continues to move between windos in both... find a way to do this...
- Make "arch-setup" an executable in ~/.local/bin
- Make flag(s) in my arch setup to only do *some* of the functionality ... e.g. --stow flag to not do the whole packages update ... ask chatgpt if that's a usual api or if it's more normal to specify the things we aren't doing... e.g. --nosync
- CONFIGURE a shell fzf-based fuzzy finder that INSERTS THE CHOSEN FILE PATH directly into the shell prompt (or if not possible, copies it to the clipboard)... get chatgpt to help with this!!
- Set the locale properly, currently I'm getting issues..
- WORK OUT how to get vim integrations into neo tree so I can modify things WHILST I'm scrolling through the tree as well, ideally if poss..
- Cannot uninstall bsdtar for some reason... uninstall it properly from my machine..
- Find or make a quick and easy nvim shortcut for switching between buffers using hjkl keys and some other of the control keys for quick switch so I can quickly switch between multiple of them...
- Find a way to make it that when you clikc enter on a neotree file you're selecting, it SHUTS neotree after it opens the new file... that's the default behaviour that I really want to be honest...
- At some point soon, really spend some time setting up copilot.lua, and understanding how best to use the workflow. Watch videos and read some stuff online to read optimise how I use the workflow... for now I guess just use it like I used to use it on vscode, but update that for a more optimised flow soon enough..
    - Although I think it doesn't suggest if I'm not in insert mode... so I can just go to normal mode and it wont, which is really good! that's probably a good starting point for configuring it in such a way that it doesn't get in the way too much visually whilst I'm trying to think and code etc...
    - People make the point that setting tab in copilot to complete might get in the way with the other syntax highlighting syggestions... however, I should set THOSE to be different to accept, if I end up using them... like control tab or something
        - Moreover, when I get the remappings done for keys, I can remap either copilot complete or the other one to be done by clicking tab twice or something for ease... that can translate to control + tab or something along those lines...
- Work out how to close buffers etc properly... coz whenever I do wq it just seems to shut all buffers ... 
- Instead of having to use the arrow keys to resize vim windows, remap them to control + alt + hjkl
- In nvim, remap window resizing to sensible defaults, like control + alt + hjkl for sensible and quick window resizing of e.g. the terminal, windows I open in different places, etc etc!!! not the same as hyprland, currently for nvim windows I have to use the arrow keys which is annoying...
- Make functionality in nvim for some sort of easy sidebar to appear with an llm / chatgpt , IDEALLY with multiple tabs / conversations that I can have going on in tandem, and even more ideally associated with the current codebase that I'm using so that it 'remembers' the history of the chat for the session! and, similar to control + / to open the terminal, make it have obvious and easy to remember ways to open it??
- Configure 'noice.nvim' to make bigger popup windows when it prints stuff to the console so that I can see the errors more easily!!!
- Get rid of prompt when I quit zsh... every time it asks me if I want to close it which I don't want it to do!!
- Use qutebrowser, make a shortcut to open the current page in chrome quickly (or actually maybe integrate everthing with firefox and set up the password manager I connected to with the firefox thing as well)... and then remap the chatgpt UI to open in that instead.. make super + F be firefox (it's mapped to something currently so change this back), and then make super + B be the browser (qutebrowser)
- I think make switching between windows and with hjkl and also with numbers be super + shift... but then just remap the caps lock key to my functionality... for switching windows...
- At some point when I stop using the gui for chatgpt, then remap the terminal loading shortcut on hyprland to super + enter, rather than super + space like I'm doing now... the only reason that I'm using super + space is because the super + enter is already taken for submitting text to the chatgpt gui....
- Make that when nvim starts it ALWAYS sets the pwd to the top of the projects that I'm working on (e.g. where the git ignore is)... I can set this up in settings...
- Possibly disable the opening and closing brackets that work automatically bc they kinda annoy me tbh!!
- See if what my nvim is showing at the top are tabs or buffers (there must be a way to check)... maybe move them to the bottom of the screen, or maybe get rid of them, depending on what I want!
- Change the font maybe to jetbrains mono??
- Make the default width of the file explorer SMALLER!! currently it's too wide when it starts off....
- Install fzf or whatever I need to run executables...
- I think I'm a bit burned out from all this vim stuff.. give it a break for a while!!!
- Enable auto-saving I think for vim-files... unless I wanna open them in a mode when they don't autosave? Bc in general it's useful for me to autosave them? Or maybe don't do this idk... see how I'm feeling...


- Move my aliases to .zshenv so that they load when I run commands with ! in vim:
      ```Telling Vim to always use an interactive shell can create problems. A better solution is to figure out what in your bash configuration sets up aliases and how you can move that to a place that is loaded even in non-interactive shells. For example, zshell only loads ~/.zshrc for interactive shells, but it loads ~/.zshenv for all shells, so I moved my alias setup there and it now works from within Vim. See man zsh (or your shell's man pages) for more.```

- Work out how to save tmux sessions (and how it works with them running in the background or not? what if I just want to save the terminal history etc but don't want them to be constaltly running every time I wake up the terminal..?)... see how this works..
- I completely disabled blink.cmp ... really , I do want the drop down suggestions, I just don't want the ugly grey suggestions to the right... see how I can do that instead??
- look into obsidian.nvim 
- Follow up on my issue in the kmonad repo and see if I can come up with any fixes for it??j;
- Consider maybe getting a chatgpt api... and monitoring regularly how much I'm using / the cost... and then using it in the cli for various productivity hacks across my workload, as well as for q and a, rather than using the web interface which is less nice... for simpler tasks I can just use a simpler model... or potentially even use claude?? ... also have a look at clwrap... it SEEMS TO use copilot which actually should do most if not all of what I want to do ... so I think this should be a good solution!! practise using copilot in nvim etc so that I get good at that...
- Consider remapping caps lock whilst holding to be ALT, and then then remap ALT + hjkl to remap to just the arrow keys for non-vim applications...
- Test the installation of the arch-bootloader script etc using QEMU to recreate a "PC-VM"...
- Fix todoist being blurry on my thinkpad, bc of wayland, see what the fix is...
- Follow up with the kmonad issue I posted on github about my trackpoint... if there's no fix, read through the source code and do it myself... add this to my todo in the software section in todoist...
- Maybe get some sort of emulator on my laptop to test out whether the bootstrap script I made actually works... find a good one for linux!!!
- Practise using VISUAL mode ON THE COMMAND LINE  to copy and paste commands etc... it works !!!
- Set up the whole hibernation shtick and MAKE IT PART OF THE ARCH BOOTSTRAPPING SCRIPT!!
- Find out what the EE wifi is on the tube and whether I'm entitled to it as an EE internet and wifi customer??
- Find way to resize panes quickly with good shortcuts whilst in vim potentially for when I want to ??
- Also find a way to make my terminal in vim look more like my terminal in the cli..
- Also find a way to quickly resize text in my terminal so that I can have smaller mini terminals open when I want them without it looking to small... could even make them auto-resize when the terminal window gets smaller!! That would be best I think so that I can have the pane in the bottom or whatever and as I resize it the text will change.. maybe do this as well for vim when it goes below a certain size??...
- Find some plugin for my cli that allows me to search for files recursively within my home directory so that I don't have to type out the whole path every time... and make it include directories as well so that I can cd into them ... like so that I can cd into that home directory using a quick fuzzy-finder or something, look into the options for this!!
- Find the vim keyboard shortcut to edit things between e.g. /'s in a path quickly.. ciw nor ciW does exactly that.. maybe tree-sitter or something...
- Called the dotfile executables / function 'dfl' from the cli as easier to type! have a proper help section (generated by chatgpt) which explains what all of the things do quickly and what all the availabel functions etc are... make a `dfl todo XX` command, where XX is the todo task which is appended to the file... e.g. `dfl todo "Finish writing feature for thing"` ... this should immediately git add the todo, commit it with the message "Added new item to TODO.md: [first 10 words + ...]
- Remap my caps lock to esc... HOLDING DOWN remap to SUPER + SHIFT to switch between workspaces... and remap shift + caps to caps lock.. 
- Make it when that I switch between workspaces in hyprland, a little thing appears in the TOP-RIGHT corner showing which workspace I'm now in.
	- Also make some nice little shortcut for navigating BETWEEN workspaces... like super + shift + hjkl.
- Find a way to perform actions with selected text in vim (in visual mode). Make a shortcut at somepoint to quickly copy selected text to the clipboard.
- There are lots of things I current DON'T like about my nvim setup that stops me using it I think.
	- I arguable prefer the font on normal vim.
	- Make the text wraparound.
	- Find all the (visual) things I don't like an improve them asap!
- Zsh not working by default as startup shell on my computer from startup script.. find out why not..
- I THINK ... switch super + c and super + q .... make opening the terminal be super + T, and make quitting a window be super + Q ... seems more sensible to me!!
- thinkpad  still seems not have to have all fonts. Download some better fonts and set them to the system default.
- Set up kmonad for some other things on my keyboard, e.g. the mouse button... press once for clicking, hold to scroll as currently...
- Set up some function keys that I think would be useful for copy paste... maybe some volume functionality as well...
- Store all my systemd files in my dotfiles repo as well?? see if that works and if it will automatically detect them and start them on a new machine?? maybe also add at the end of my arch-setup.sh that if it's the first time doing these things I should probably do a restart of the computer... ALSO CURRENTLY in my kmonad file in /etc/systemd/system/kmonad.service ... it's hard-coded to my username as 'yac'... I need to CHANGE both pc and laptop to have the same username (yonah), and differentiate them by their hostnames :: 'thinkpad' vs 'thinkcentre'
- Remap the capslock to esc for once and capslock for twice (and maybe control for hold??)
- Make my thinkbutton less sensitive!!
- PRACTISE USING THE TEE COMMAND!
# Other todos
- Every time I run the arch-install script I get locale warnings.
- Set these up to stop the warnings and would be a good thing to do anyways!
- Make some sort of configuration file in 'dotfiles' to simplify?? Maybe like a config.json or a config.ini or something like that... this can also be used by the 'dotfiles' cmdlet, and will mean I can centralise any params that won't be used globally.
- Somewhere in the arch setup script raise an error if the internet connection is not working.
	- Find the most 'legit' way to test in a script whether things are actually working with your connection to the internet.
- Make a separate script / cmdlet for connecting to wifi.
- After hibernating for a while, systemd-networkd often stop working for some reason.
	- Find out why this is.
	- If there's no obvious reason, try make a post-hibernation hook that restarts it: `sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd`
- There's a stage in my arch-setup that does NOT proceed without confirmation... find what stage this is (a yay install or something) and add the --noconfirm switch...
- Find a way to do gh auth as automated as possible as well...

- Work out with tree-sitter how I can get it to recognise sentences for typing txt and md files, etc. This would be useful for jumping around sentences quickly.
- SET UP copy and paste shortcuts for control + shift + v ... change it for chrome so that it uses the same shortcuts?? bc currently it only works with control + c and control + v??


##### OTHER STUFF ######
- I've spoken somewhere above about adding a command to add a quick section header (like in hypr.conf) to vim files... I think the command should be 'nsec NEW_SECTION_NAME' ... also make a command 'sec' that lists all the sections...
- To make vim nicer scrolling, when I do control + d or control + u , I actually don't like the fact that it just moves instantly, makes it hard to follow.... find a way to make it that it does a 'scrolling' animation, just a really really quick one... so I can still see the mvoement that has happened when I scrolled down, and keep track of where I am!!
- I want a better way to use whatsapp on my machine... see if there's already some whatsapp app that allows you to use some sort of vim keybindings, and scrolling through chats without having to use the mouse... otherwise see if I can set one up... if I manage to , at some point could open source it! Add this to my open-source to do list of projects that I have on my todoist!!
- I think I want to have BOTH the relative and absolute line numbers in vim... see if any other people have a good way of having both in a clear manner... like the absolute ones being left most and bolt, and then relative being to the right of them and in italics or something... look around other people's setups and see how they do it / if it's advisable...


- Make a SEPARATE PARTITION FOR MY HOME/YONAH FOLDER(S) AND COPY JUST THEM TO MY ONEDRIVE... this way also I can quickly re-install the linux system and run my whole script etc without having to worry about files being persisted etc... Will make life easier methinks and is good practise!!!

- Make a section of my arch-install.sh script for checking if some of my vim packages are installed... and if not, installing them... e.g.vim wayland keyboard

- MAKE THE THINK BUTTON RED THING ON MY THINKPAD LESS SENSITIVE!!! cURRENTLY IT's superrrr sensitive, which is a bit much and makes it hard to scroll and move the mouse around effectively without overshooting... definitely a way to configure this better :))

- find out why when I do the super + control to either side of my keyboard, and try to switch between workspaces, it doesn't work!!! fix this..
- Look into mason-lspconfig.nvim .... and look into how dependency management works in pacman... I was getting an error bc I didn't have unzip installed... this should be an auto-installed dependency surely? or maybe this is more of the lazy.nvim thing (actually yeah I think it is..)... find out how this should be included in the install script or whatever, or how the error can be clearer and then speak to them about it and see what they can can do!!
- CONFIGURE HYPRLAND to have super + c be copy (NOT close -remove that from the config), and super + v be paste!!!!
- Make better shortcuts for nvim... such as an alternative to control + w, and generally a better shortcut to make windows thinner (instead of control + w, then <).
- make a remove section for the files that I uninstalled on one machine so that they're auto-removed on another machine..


- at some point try out a few different machine in qemu ... some for the apple 2, early dos computers, see what they were like!! is kinda cool to be able to do that!!

- practise PASTING over text in vim (without having to delete it first and adding it to the null register...) .... the way to do this is by first visually selecting what I want to paste over, and then pasting it..

- Make a command "df config XXXX" e.g. "df config hypr".... make a mapping file between a given name, and the config file used to config them... if one doesn't exist, it should prompt you to ask if you wanna create a new mapping... e.g. if you type "df config tmux" and you haven't yet mapped a config file to tmux, it should prompt you to ask if you want to provide a path to the file it should map to.. to store these, keep a json file in the $dotfiles root called .config_shortcuts.json or something ...

- Doubt it's possible but see if there's a way to disable chatpt completions once you've inserted a comment like # ... so that it isn't suggesting annoying comments... or at least reject a suggestion once it gives one to clear the screen and make it easier to read/think...

- Use the built-in neovim terminal mainly when I want to do something that requires looking at the code at the same time... otherwise basically use a dedicated terminal where possible!!
