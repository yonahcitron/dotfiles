ToDo today:

- Set up kmonad for some other things on my keyboard, e.g. the mouse button... press once for clicking, hold to scroll as currently...
- Set up some function keys that I think would be useful for copy paste... maybe some volume functionality as well...
- Store all my systemd files in my dotfiles repo as well?? see if that works and if it will automatically detect them and start them on a new machine?? maybe also add at the end of my arch-setup.sh that if it's the first time doing these things I should probably do a restart of the computer... ALSO CURRENTLY in my kmonad file in /etc/systemd/system/kmonad.service ... it's hard-coded to my username as 'yac'... I need to CHANGE both pc and laptop to have the same username (yonah), and differentiate them by their hostnames :: 'thinkpad' vs 'thinkcentre'
- Remap the capslock to esc for once and capslock for twice (and maybe control for hold??)
- Make my thinkbutton less sensitive!!

# Other todos
- Every time I run the arch-install script I get locale warnings.
- Set these up to stop the warnings and would be a good thing to do anyways!
