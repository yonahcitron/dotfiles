- return to the heilige torah... but realise that hashem sent all this stuff for a reason... so return better, stronger, with love, not with fear, with confidence in it being right and in people's ability to choose correctly... and in it fitting in with the world... and being a beautiful things... and not a thing of superiority or fear... just of truth and love... and how the torah is such a gift.. really focus on this...

- it's really feeling like an eis sha'ah, a time to return, a time to be who I always was, the young heilige yonah, the reb yonah, the pure, loving, peaceful yonah, who's been lucky enough to be born in good place, and to do good things, and to try spread that further around the world... that confidence which has kept me going.. to reconnect to that true source, and to music, and to all good things like that...

- go to shul on friday, and pray to hashem to make everything better. to heal our vengefulness and fill our hearts again with compassion. to heal all the people who we've hurt, and make everyone live in peace.

See everything I'm doing today, and in general the work I do, as not necessarily an end to itself, but as a means of achieving the things that I want...
- Of being able to read up the thoughts I want... and connecting to the right things..
- Get the thoughts I want..
- Judaism is so beautiful... but not the Judaism I've found so recently... read up thoughts of good thinkers, about the 'true' way of Judaism and how to find a better path than what we have currently..
- Look into chassidus...


- LATER PUT ON TEFILLIN, DAVEN, ASK FOR UNDERSTANDING AND GOODNESS IN MY LIFE, CONNECT TO JUDAISM, TO THE RIGHT THIGNS...

- All the depression I regularly feel, it's all for a reason ... it's all to get me to the right path, to the path of truth that I've felt since the beginning... since the knowledge I had as a child..

- Of the beauty of the Jewish way... need to get back to that  indeed...


- rename all $dotfiles to $DOTFILES....
