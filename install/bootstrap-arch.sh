# TODO: Soon move my arch-install.sh into this folder, and call it arch-setup or something. I'll need to change the paths in it to where it's instaled new.
# TODO: Document in THIS file that this one should be used whilst in the live usb, and should be manually copied to the live usb for first setup. The other one should be run (document it there) whenever I want to sync my system, or at first install, in my user shell. I think go and configure an env variable for first setup.
